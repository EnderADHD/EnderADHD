Hey! My name is Ender or EnderADHD! I'm a Programmer, Fencer, Cook, Musician with maybe a little too many hobbies. You probably couldn't guess but I have ADHD and Autism and no my entire personality doesnt revolve around that, in fact I hate it when people's only personality traits are the things they are diagnosed with.
